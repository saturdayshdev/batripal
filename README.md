### BatriPal

A voice-first personal companion to guide individuals on their bariatric journey. Every year, over 600,000 people undergo bariatric surgery, a transformative but often challenging process. Bariatric surgery requires not only physical adjustments to diet and lifestyle but also emotional support through the recovery period. Yet, this group remains largely underserved in terms of tailored support systems.

Batripal addresses both the nutritional and emotional needs of post-op bariatric patients. As a user, you can interact with the assistant through voice, receiving personalized insights on food choices, progress tracking, and motivation. On the emotional side, Batripal provides comforting conversations to support users through tough moments.

I am personally connected to this project: I underwent bariatric surgery a year ago and lost 70 kg in 9 months. This journey has inspired me to build a tool that I wish I had during my own recovery.
